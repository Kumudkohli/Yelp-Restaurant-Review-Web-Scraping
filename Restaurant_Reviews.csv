Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,497 reviews)",Amazing service. Despite being busy they have a great system for getting you seated quickly. Such a cool vibe in there. Some of the best Thai food I've had in a while. Cant wait to come back when I am in Toronto.,Abby P.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,497 reviews)","Great food, great service! We went on a Tuesday night and there was about a 50 min wait. There's regular table and communal table which we got sat at. It's perfectly fine! The food was absolutely delicious! The panang curry and pad kra prow were my favorites! The thai spicy level was so spicy!!! Would recommend farang spicy or medium if possible. The coconut sorbet was absolutely delicious!!! Great way to end the night",Sana T.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,497 reviews)","We got here late at 9:30pm on a Saturday night.  A good size restaurant with plenty of seating and a variety of decor, really liked that.  About 70% full, got seated immediately.  A mostly young crowd at that hour.  We chose only main dishes as the kitchen was closing in less than a half hour.  A Basil Thai stir fry and a Penang curry, neither of which are specific to northern Thailand.  The Penang curry with beef was about average, not enough zing to the sauce, and it was not served hot enough, I let that pass due to the lateness of the hour. The stir fry presented nicely, very colourful, once again though served only lukewarm.  Wait staff were extremely friendly and professional.  I wish we had ordered something more specific to the North of Thailand like the khao suey and so can only give an average rating to the food due to the taste of the dishes we did order, but give an excellent rating to the ambiance, service and value.  We will return for another taste.",Sohail M.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,497 reviews)","This seemed to be the most frequently and highly reviewed restaurant in all of Toronto, on both YelpAnd Google, so I had to give it a try. When you think of a place like Toronto, your first instinct is that Canadian food would be the most popular. But Canada is a melting pot of cultures, and there's a strong Asian influence here. We figured all the rave reviews about this place was reason enough to see what all the hype was about. We got here on a Tuesday evening and it was so packed that we waited for 35 minutes!! I couldn't believe how busy it was on a Tuesday. That was my initial indication that I was about to have some good food. The ambiance was casual but cool at the same time. Have you ever been to one of those famous people that post famous people's pictures who have visited their restaurant on the wall before? It was very much like that. While we were waiting for a table we decided to have a drink at the bar. There were no bar stools which was great because we didn't have to fight anyone for the bartenders attention, so we stayed standing up ordering drinks and enjoying them. We had the Lowry and the Thai mojito, my fiancés favorite was the Lowry and mine was the Thai mojito. Both were Very smooth and easy to drink. Once we sat down, the service was incredibly fast which was surprising since it was so busy. We were attended to right away, they would come backTo check on us and if we needed anything, it wouldn't take long to get it. We noticed that the most popular item on Yelp was the pad Thai, so even though it's such a typical Thai food item, we had to try it. The pad Thai was really good, we got almost the spiciest level (faraang spicy) and added extra spice on the side but it wasn't as spicy as Thai food in LA where we're originally from usually is. The pad Thai was my fiancés favorite all time pad Thai, I'm a little bit more of a food snob, to me it was a solid 4.5 star out of 5, loved it but I feel like I've had slightly better, but it was definitely top 10 I've ever had everywhere I've traveled. We ordered the grabong (squash fritters), even though we read a review from someone saying that it didn't have flavor. Let me tell you, as long as you dip it in the dip they provide you, it is popping full of flavor. By itself without the dip, it's pretty plain. We loved it and dipped to our hearts content. I noticed the Khao Soi soup looking dish seemed like my kind of meal, so I couldn't pass up ordering it, and I'm glad I did. There was so much broth that after eating it with the noodles, I ordered white rice and added it into the soup and it's like I had 2 meals from the same dish. And in my opinion it was great with noodles but even better with the white rice!! The flavor was also finger licking good. I would love to come back and try more dishes here",Aram K.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,497 reviews)","Everyone said we had to eat here while in Toronto. We arrived ten minutes after opening on a Saturday afternoon. I'm not sure how large the restaurant has and how many rooms but it seemed already pretty full when we got there. We were sat straight away. Service was decent. You use the QR code for the menu. A lot of items aren't available til after 4pm - which is a shame. I had the Pad See Ew with shrimp which was delicious, the rice noodles were great, I like that they gave you the spice on the side so you could add your own heat level. My husband didn't order well and went with the Chiang Mai Beef Noodle Soup, he was looking for something like Drunken Noodles which is what my dish was similar to, he wanted wide noodles and messed up! Lol. His dish was still good but not what he was looking for.",Emma B.,4
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,497 reviews)","My girlfriend and I needed some Thai food in our life while we're visiting Toronto and Pai looked exactly what we were looking for. The place has really cute decor and the staff is extremely nice. They have a pretty extensive menu so there's a little bit of something for everyone. My gf and I started with the chicken wings and orders Pad Thai and Khao Soi. Both were incredible, the flavors were on point for all three items. We grabbed a few drinks and those were fantatsic as well! Prices were pretty good all around and won't break the bank. If my gf and I ever find ourselfs in Toronto we will definitely be back!",Jesus H.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,497 reviews)","Absolutely loved this place! There was a wait time for 25 minutes, but I was called within 5 minutes of joining the wait list. The waiter took the time to go over the entire menu and explained which ones I could go with according to my taste pallete. Got to try their lychee cocktail which is Tequila based and also ordered their Pad grow Pro vegan bacon which was out of the world. It's a must try!!  Ambience was good too with enough seating and waiting area",Chithra V.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,497 reviews)","What a great way to kick off our first meal in Toronto! Since it was the highest reviewed spot we figured it has to be good! We went for a late lunch, around 3:30-4ish. They told us it would be about a 20 minute wait but we only waited like 10 minutes.For food we ordered the Pai Thai with chicken and the Khao Soi Beef 22 CAD each. Omg you NEED to order the Khao Soi, I could literally just drink the sauce forever. The Pai Thai was good but I feel like I've had better, it wasn't bad just not the best I've ever had. Portions are pretty substantial, so you could probably share and get an appetizer.The decor inside is cool, with fun details. Service was good and staff was friendly. I definitely recommend visiting this place while in Toronto!!",Marisa C.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,497 reviews)","So good, it kind of ruined Thai food (non-Pai) for me foreverWaited about a half hour on a Saturday afternoon. Seems a little silly to have a waiting space when it could just be more seats, but it works and you'll find people waiting. They offer a call back but I'm visiting from US so we opted to wait. We were just about to order our Thai teas from the bar when we were seated - wish there was more encouragement to take advantage of the bar while waiting, but I digressThe Khao Soi is OUT OF THIS WORLD. The presentation and the lightness of the curry go hand-in-hand to a really special experience. It's pretty big and can be shared. We also had some skewers that were so moist and tender. Yum yum!This was also just peak experience for us - the restaurant is so cute and so much to look at. The staff is extremely kind and friendly too, they even gave us some city recommendations. Yeah I can't eat from any other Thai restaurant again. Thanks a lot you guys (sarcasm here)",Erin L.,5
Pai Northern Thai Kitchen,"(3,497 reviews)","You can't tell from the outside but this place is MASSIVE .. there was a long long but for good reason. The line goes fast and have a coconut water and Thai ice tea was great. Some of the best Thai food of my life. We live in Pittsburgh PA, and Toronto is a five hour drive cool city and this place will make it work the drive.",Jamie S.,5
Mira,(272 reviews),"I had an amazing time at Mira during a recent visit to Toronto. The food, ambiance, and service was amazing. The bartender Keenen took care of me and gave me great recommendations for food and cocktails. I ordered for the empanadas, broccolini, and corn. All three dishes were so flavorful and just as Keenen had described them. The restaurant is nicely decorated and provides a nice dining experience whether you are dining alone or with friends. If I am ever back in Toronto I will definitely make my way back to Mira. Ask for Keenen he is an amazing bartender and overall pleasure to talk to.",Nakema G.,5
Mira,(272 reviews),"We tried 7 different dishes and everything was tasty. The yucca frittas we our least favourite, a bit bland but the dipping sauces were yummy. Great variety of dishes at this Peruvian/Japanese restaurant. Very friendly service and nice decor. Great selection of interesting cocktails too. Scallop ceviche was silky and delicious. Waygu beef was delicious with the fried onion crisps. Short rib with sweet potato was amazing too!Definitely worth checking out Mira!",Yum+Yummer M.,5
Mira,(272 reviews),"Mira is such a lovely restaurant and I would highly recommend visiting if you're looking for some amazing Peruvian food! We got:- Scallop ceviche: this was amazing. The scallops were soft and the sauce suited the dish very well. Spicy but not overly spicy with the rocoto and overall very tasty.- Polpo: this octopus dish was fantastic. It was grilled and had a nice smoky flavour. It was served on top mashed potato, which also went with the dish well.- Branzino: they removed the main bone from this dish which was really nice! We got the smaller option and it was enough for 2 people. This was also very good.",Amanda S.,5
Mira,(272 reviews),"My group of 6 came for dinner on a Wednesday night right before the end of the year/holidays. We had a reservation, but I noticed the restaurant was still quiet around 6pm and started to fill up within the next hour. I loved the ambiance of the restaurant! It started right when you entered through a slightly hidden walk way in a side alley that was lined with lanterns. The inside was decorated with lots of twinkle lights, candles, and garlands for the holiday season.What we ordered (shared family style):- Edamame- Wagyu Tataki- Shishito Peppers- Ceviche Trio (Lychee + Scallop + Salmon)- Yucca Fries- Pollo a la Brassa- Branzino- Tres LechesMy favs:- Edamame is a simple starter but it was very well seasoned- Scallop ceviche was my favorite out of the trio- Wagyu tataki was great with the citrus of the ponzu and crunch from the crispy shallots- Pollo was okay but the potato pancake side it came with was great. Like a mash potato with an almost tartness that made it very interestingFinal thoughts:Great vibes for a date night or special dinner. Some of the plates were great, others were just okay and I was expecting more at this price point. For the price, I do think you can get better value elsewhere but I'd come again.",Michelle W.,3
Mira,(272 reviews),"Location: 4 Located in a quaint, charming alleyway in older downtown Toronto's Fashion District. We walked from our hotel but judging from the area street parking could be a challenge. Venue: 5 Trendy and very nicely decorated and well-appointed. Medium-sized venue with indoor and outdoor seating options. They do take reservations, which is highly recommended.Ambiance: 4 Trendy and upscale. Service: 4 Professional and courteous. Very attentive.Food: 4 The cuisine is a unique blend of Peruvian and Japanese food. Offerings range from small plates to individual meals. Our server recommended that we take 2 to 3 small plates per person, which we did. I have posted pictures of what we ordered, and they all looked good and tasted great. Ingredients were of highest quality and very fresh. We had the $32 (CAD) dessert El Huevo Malo which is a huge ball of chocolate full of sweets! It is enough for 4 or more people and it was a unique experience where you have to break the chocolate bar to partake in the goodies held within :)Drinks: 4 Large selection of unique, tasty and good-looking signature drinks, sake, wine and beer. Priced above average. The mixologist delivered every specialty cocktail himself and it was obvious that he was very proud of his unique creations!The last word: 4 All in all, a great unique dining adventure. Presentation and flavors were spot on. Definitely recommended!",Ara G.,4
Mira,(272 reviews),The food was so fresh and amazing! Drinks were great as well. Ambiance was beautiful and very different. Our server was extremely informative and helped us ALOT with our choices. I wish I could've tried the desert but I was stuffed looked awesome too.,Areana D.,5
Mira,(272 reviews),"The entrance to Mira is hidden on a side alleyway with minimal signage (look for string lights!) I came here on a Tuesday night with two girlfriends, and Mira was not very busy. Our waiter was super nice and attentive throughout the evening. He recommended ordering 2-3 dishes per person. We opted for:- Hiramusa (King Fish) Ceviche: I wasn't too familiar with the ingredients of this ceviche, but combined together, it still felt quite classic to me - great refreshing appetizer- Costilla Anticucho: Peruvian skewers were a hit - the meat was very tender, and the sweet potato toppings added a nice crunch- Arroz Azafrán (Saffron Rice): compared to the rest of our dishes, I didn't find  this rice to be very flavourful - probably would pass on this one next time- Yucca Fritas: not sure if I've had yucca fries before, but the texture was very satisfying - slightly crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside- Maíz: despite its simplicity, I thoroughly enjoyed this corn dishThrowback R&B was playing throughout dinner (not complaining as this is my favourite genre of music) but it did make me wonder about the authenticity of this restaurant. I guess it fits with the neighbourhood! Mira is slightly pricier than your average joint, but the quality is higher than other restaurants in the nearby King West area (and has cute llama motifs throughout).",Cynthia W.,4
Mira,(272 reviews),"Ridiculously good. The vibe is awesome - super cool, tattoo-inspired decor. Bartenders made amazing recommendations. Must haves:Vieira ceviche - thick fresh pieces of seafood, squid ink cracker is a cool extra little touch.Tuna tostada - has a great spicy kick to it, super fresh, love the creaminess.Wagyu - beautifully cooked to the perfect doneness, juicy, flavourful.Maiz - crunchy yet juicy, sweet & salty, rich & creamy. 10/10.And don't you dare miss the Maracuyano cocktail - it's so refreshing, a great selection for anyone who loves mojitos & Moscow mules.",Jasmine K.,5
Mira,(272 reviews),"Beautiful restaurant, excellent service, delicious food. We would definitely return. I had this bookmarked for a while and picked it because it wasn't too far from the theatre. It is on Wellington, west of Spadina.I am sensitive to raw onions and they were terrific accommodating me.Everything was really good, but the standout were the tuna tostada, cauliflower and apparently the scallop ceviche.",Sammie S.,5
Mira,(272 reviews),"We visited this place on Sunday evening for dinner. The restaurant is hidden on a side lane between King and Wellington. Overall ambiance is good and food has small portions. You will need to order at least 2 dishes per person. The cocktails are amazing and innovative. I maybe not try this again, but definitely worth one time experience.",Nimish H.,5
Katsuya,(502 reviews),"One of the best spots for katsu downtown. Highly recommend the carbonara, garlic, and cheesy brick katsu styles. Their fries with honey butter powder is also really tasty. Interior is spacious and industrial/hip. Lively kpop music. Came at 4 pm on a weekend and there was no wait. Service was very quick. Definitely check this place out, you won't regret it!",Kelly C.,5
Katsuya,(502 reviews),"I've never had proper katsu, but I've had plenty of other Japanese and other Asian cuisine. No qualms about this being my first experience. It's a small space, probably no more than 30 people will fit, but it feels more cozy than cramped.The menu, while large, seems mostly similar to each other at first. Then while reading through I began to feel like the small differences between options was more like customizing my preferences than being limited.My waitress was very busy (solo serving the whole room) but came to me as quickly as possible. She was extremely friendly despite being obviously swamped.I ordered original fish katsu and received it in an appropriate time frame. The fish itself was a bit bland, and the sauce was very mild in flavor. Good, but mild. The ginger was a nice addition to kick the flavor up a notch. The rice was perfectly cooked, but it was just compressed white rice, not sticky rice, so it fell apart very quickly when it met the sauce of the fish katsu. Positives; the cabbage salad and its drizzled sauce was a VERY nice addition to the plate. It helped tremendously at cutting through the heaviness of the fried fish and thick sauce. Big kudos on that one. Also the onion soup that came with it was beautiful. Flavorful and delicious. No complaints on that at all. Unrelated to the food, there is an ATM right outside the entrance and Katsudon offers (at least at the time of this) 10% off all cash payments.",Roberto B.,4
Katsuya,(502 reviews),"Katsuya used to be one of my go-to places when I was downtown and craving katsu. I haven't been in a few years, but stopped by before a concert recently and it's just as I remembered.What I got:- Japanese Pork Loin Katsu Final Thoughts:The katsu is quite large and crispy while remaining moist inside. The Japanese Katsu is one of the only options without nuts so this is my go-to as I have an allergy. It comes with a tangy dipping sauce, miso soup, cabbage, and rice. I remember the cabbage and soup being refillable for free but I didn't get a refill this visit so I can't say for sure if that is still offered. The salad dressing for the cabbage used to be on the table pre-covid, but now they add it for you before bringing you your food so I found the cabbage quite bitter and underdressed as I used to drench it in sauce aha.Other than the dressing no longer being self-serve, this spot is just as I remembered it! It's a bit pricey coming close to $20 per meal so I wouldn't get this regularly but when the craving hits it's a great treat.",Michelle W.,4
Katsuya,(502 reviews),"I haven't tried many katsu restaurants so I can't really compare but Katsuya has some pretty good katsu! Their menu selection is large with different types of ""sauces"" such as their house sauce, mayo flavours, garlic sweet chilli, Japanese style, and more. They even have katsu stuffed with cheese! They have a selection of appetizers to choose from as well. Their katsu dishes also come with a side of soup, it is normally miso soup but due to low supply chain they replaced it with udon broth. It had a nice bonito dashi flavour and completes your meal! They also offer free refills on the soup if you would like more to wash down your katsu. My go to order is usually their Japanese style Katsu with pork loin. The katsu pieces are cooked well with a crispy batter outside but the meat is still quite juicy on the inside. Their dipping sauce is on the side so you can dip as much as you prefer. They also provide a small bowl of sesame seeds to ground up and add to your dish as well. The whole set comes with ginger, yellow pickled radish, shredded cabbage to cut the grease and a bowl of rice. The portion size is big so I was full by the end of my meal. Staff here are really friendly and service was quick and efficient. They also offer a 10% discount if you pay with cash. I'd come back here if I ever crave katsu! Convenient location across TMU university.",Lisa T.,4
Katsuya,(502 reviews),"The katsu was fried to perfection. It was a good amount of food, I couldn't finish it. The service was a little slow because they only had one waiter and one  cook. We got the honey fries and all my friends loved it. It was both sweet and salty - unique.",Nancy H.,5
Katsuya,(502 reviews),"Fun, casual environment inside when my girlfriend and I came on a Monday for Lunch. Not too busy, and promptly seated. I got the Japanese katsu with chicken, and it was yummy! The chicken was super moist and the flaky bread crumbs were super light. My girlfriend got the honeycomb fish katsu. I was a little skeptical at first, but her plate was arguably better than mine and super aesthetically pleasing. Huge amount of food! Delicious casual restaurant and I would come back again. Recommend!",Manny L.,4
Katsuya,(502 reviews),"Ordered to-go late dinner upon our arrival to Toronto for vacation. This place was 7-min walk & opened until 10. Ordering by phone was easy, food was ready in 15 minutes. The front door was kind of hidden. The food was ready & packed when we got there. The cashier was friendly. Simple decor inside, more spacious that it seemed from outside. The portions were quite generous, with leftovers for another meal for 2 ppl (there were 4 of us). Everything was delicious for our starving tummies. The curry sauce was very mild, could be a little more flavor for my taste, but perfect for my daughter. Hubby really enjoyed the carbonara sauce. Daughter's fave was the pork katsu. My favorite was the fish katsu. The crabmeat croquettes were DELICIOUS, perfect with its tasty cheesy sauce. This place is definitely worth it, must-try in Toronto downtown.",Kristina W.,5
Katsuya,(502 reviews),"Delicious!!!! A place full of amazing Katsu! Just Yumm. I've got delivery from here and some dine in. Chicken katsu: perfect! Perfectly crispy, crunchy, moist. Just all around balanced meal with their sauce. The pork katsu carbonara: delicious twist!Takoyaki! Yummmm! I'm not the first person to order takoyaki but they sure make it well here. And the curry katsu! The curry is definitely the star. So good, can't wait to return and dine in so I get the crispiest and crunchiest Katsus!",Latifa S.,4
Katsuya,(502 reviews),"I had the Japanese pork katsu wanting just a regular don katsu. There's something very strange about their katsu sauce. It just wasn't right- something is added to it or something... just unnecessary when you can just use bulldog sauce. The experience of the food was very sub par. Fried crispy, but again, just okay. I wouldn't go back.",Sue J.,2
Katsuya,(502 reviews),"4.5 stars: really enjoyed the Katsu (and would highly recommend trying the cheese Katsu). The breading was perfectly flakey and the meat was cooked just right. Personally, I was not a huge fan of the garlic spicy sauce, but curry was alright.",Sarah T.,5
Gusto 101,"(1,152 reviews)","It's one of my favourite Italian restaurant. Good quality of food, good taste and good service.",Milena M.,4
Gusto 101,"(1,152 reviews)","Hands down my favorite Italian restaurant in Toronto. I've been there twice and would definitely go again. Their ambiance is super nice as well with a closed rooftop seating, a patio seating and an indoor high top / regular seating. I love their sausage pizza and their mushroom pasta, definitely my go to dishes, just try!",Dhriti C.,5
Gusto 101,"(1,152 reviews)",Great place for Italian food. The restaurant has two levels. Lower level has a bar inside and some outdoor seating. The upper level is the rooftop with a centre table beautifully decorated in glass.It is always crowded as the food is amazing. Tried their oyster mushroom spaghetti pasta and Rose. Both of them tasted incredible. The music was good and went well with the ambience. Definitely check out if visiting Toronto!,Chithra V.,4
Gusto 101,"(1,152 reviews)","Our best start to finish meal ever.  The drinks came out exquisite, and at first we thought we just had a one-off exceptional bartender, but then the second of our 4 rounds of drinks were made by another bartender, and those drinks were just as exquisite.   In fact the second bartender was the creator of the Vesuviano drink.   We ultimately had 5 different drinks and each one was a work of art.   That said, when it comes to art, not everyone will have the same taste.   For sure though, the attention to detail in every drink was evident from presentation to taste.   They were truly cocktail chefs providing signature cocktails.  We did try a Mojito as that has been our baseline test for whereever we drink, and their Mojito easily usurped the top of our list, and we have tasted Mojitos all over the world. The food is what led us to this restaurant, which has more of a pub / fine pizza with patio feel to it.   They already had strong ratings for their Margherita Pizza, so we ordered that.  We wanted to try a second dish as well and selected the Spaghettoni Alla Calabrese.  While we waited, we also ordered the Calamari Fritti.  This is our appetizer companions and the freshness and flavor led this to be the best we have ever had.  The dip was a light lemony mayonnaise based sauce that worked really well with the calamari.  We thought long and hard trying to provide some critical feedback, but the food was so flavorful.  At first we thought the portions were small, but ultimately, given the fine taste which led us to reduced bite sizes and taking longer to savor the flavors, the portions were just right.  Plus it insured we left enough room for dessert, which you do not want to miss.  We did read other critiques about the pizza being soggy in the middle, and while that is fairly accurate, for us, it did not bother us.  The sauce is exceptional, we completely understand why this pizza was rated so high and so frequently commented about in reviews.  The pasta was exquisite.  Slightly larger than typical spaghetti and ever so more al dente than similar pasta dishes.   The sauce was so good that my wife had to stare me down as I considered licking the dish clean.  At that point, we expected that desserts must be their failure point.   We still ordered Tiramisu, another dish we use to compare across restaurants, and the Torta De Formaggio.  Much like their drinks and entrees, so full of flavor and texture.  As with the other dishes and drinks, completely authentic flavors without being saturated with sugar or sauces, or other flavor distractions.  If you find yourself in Toronto, particularly in the Downtown / Entertainment District, it is so worth the stop.",Steven R.,5
Gusto 101,"(1,152 reviews)",WOWOWOWOWO.... Okay. First time here and we will definitely be back.Evan was our server and was so kind and informative. We're not fans of really cheesy focaccia bread and Evan assured us it was not. He was RIGHT and we absolutely LOVED IT. Soooo delicious. You have to get it and dip it in some olive oil.I cannot wait to come back and try something new. I wish I could live here but I can't afford it. It's a but on the pricier side but hey it's downtown Toronto so that's to be expected.Both of us had to go to work afterwards. Let's just say we wear corsets and sing for three hours on stage... I could hardly move I was STUFFED . Thank you Gusto 101!!!!,Charlotte W.,5
Gusto 101,"(1,152 reviews)","Came here a couple weeks ago for my friends birthday. We were sat on their rooftop patio - while it was very cute, it was extremely humid and there was little to no air flow so we were very warm. The food was fantastic, all three of us that were there got the mushroom pasta and it was SO GOOD. We also split the tiramisu between the three of us as our waitress suggested we do that as the portion was quite large for one person. We also did there dollar per ounce house wine that was great, the only thing I'll say is that I noticed our waitress would take away the wine glass when I still had some in the glass left to drink. Other than that, we really enjoyed our meal and will be back again for sure!",Bailey G.,5
Gusto 101,"(1,152 reviews)","Had the ravioli alla Norma on the patio with colleagues for lunch. I thought the pasta was a little firm for my liking. But otherwise, not bad. Good service.",Ryan W.,3
Gusto 101,"(1,152 reviews)","Just wow.... Tasted the richest mushroom flavored pasta ever made and it was A M A Z I N G. The Malfade ai Funghi is cooked with portobello, porcini, oyster mushroom and a truffle cream sauce. The size portions were just right and it can be a bit heavy so I'm glad my boyfriend ordered the Casarecce al Ragu to balance the flavors out. The mushroom pasta is rich and creamy while the ragu is towards the acidic and savory side with the iberico pork and tomato sauce. The calamari fritti was ordered as an appetizer and the batter was thin and the calamari was quite tender. Every ordered item was so delicious, the service was friendly and I love the rustic design of the restaurant's interior with the open kitchen. You can smell the amazing aroma of everything being cooked. There was very little street parking, but there was a close by private lot for $20CAD. Came here on a Monday afternoon before my flight and my boyfriend and I got seated immediately. So glad that Gusto 101 is open in the afternoons. What a great way to end our trip in Canada.",Deanna L.,5
Gusto 101,"(1,152 reviews)","Honestly, the food was only mediocre. The spot is a really cool spot with a patio upstairs in the vibe was really interesting, but again, I wouldn't go back for the food.Had the Ragu pasta, Caesar salad, and the brussels sprouts. Multiple tables around us also got the brussels sprouts and I thought the brussels sprouts were really good, and it looks like a lot of people were getting the fungi pasta, which looked good. However, everything was just mediocre in my opinion.",Lydia C.,3
Gusto 101,"(1,152 reviews)","This place is still popular after all these years. Yea, definitely need a reso here or be happy to wait.It's a lot of space. Two floors and a patio. People everywhere doing things to keep this place in motion. As soon as you are done your food someone is there to take away the plate. Bussers are fast. Although the apologized for the slow prep of our food. Took forever because the kitchen was busy. It also felt like they were rushing us through each course to get the next table in. It truly felt that way. Really bothered me.Table of four can't shovel food in very fast if the food took almost 30 minutes.The bathroom not my favourite .... I understand industrial but it sure was really rough in the bathroom stall. The washing station was fine but oh, boy the stalls not my favourite.Would I go here again for the food... maybe? I just didn't like how our server made us feel.  I was happy with my dishes so not a slam for the kitchen but customer service was not what I thought it would be.",Geraldine G.,3
The Rabbit Hole,(38 reviews),We finally went to this place after planning to go since ages!We tried their pork tenderloin and steak and chips for main course and both the items were good. The service was excellent and I think the highlight of our visit was their drinks! They have a large variety of cocktails to choose from including the basic regular ones like my all time favourite Gin & Tonic.,Ritwika B.,5
The Rabbit Hole,(38 reviews),"Well, the staff were absolutely fantastic! The wines were decent, and the food was good to ok. The food unfortunately, was underwhelming. However, I'm giving them 4 stars because the two women who I dealt with were amazing, and tbh I'm not really expecting good food at a corporate run pub in the very dead financial district, lol. The scotch eggs were okay, maybe a bit dry. The pie was also ok and maybe a bit dry, but unfortunately their thin gravy tasted like burnt flour.",Veronica V.,4
The Rabbit Hole,(38 reviews),"This place and it's decor inside is cute but we choose the patio since it's nice weather. We took the summerlicious menu. Food is good, staff are very friendly. There is construction on the street so its good take the subway, exit on Queen or King station and walk for less than 5 mins. How nice for the chef to give us (I called it pancake, I forgot it's name)  while waiting for the main menu.",Vannesa A.,4
The Rabbit Hole,(38 reviews),"Recently visited a few days ago for a work lunch. Cute old school decor with wooden panelling and a bit of Alice and Wonderland  theme. Tried a few things:1) Scotch Egg - First time I've tried this. Hen's egg, sage & nutmeg sausage, piccalilli. The piccalilli (relish) paired nicely with the egg.2) Ale-battered Halibut & Chips - if you are hungry, get this! Halibut, tartar sauce, mushy peas, and charred lemon. Light batter, fish cooked well and a favourite of the table. Everyone at the table basically ordered this. Recommend this place for work lunches and dinners. Maybe not dates or casual dining.",Danthanh L.,4
The Rabbit Hole,(38 reviews),"A great place to bring a date or after work drinks, especially for happy hour. $12 for their cocktails is pretty sweet. Loved the Adelaide Pimm's. The lavender flavor was so great for a lavender lover like me. We had their appetizer called bubbles and squeaks which was very good! It's the vegetarian version of the Dutch bitterballen. The mustard it came with was so good. Our waiter, Kieran, was attentive, friendly and gave great suggestions. Overall, a great experience and it's a place we will repeat!!",Alekhya M.,5
The Rabbit Hole,(38 reviews),"After a Friday evening at the opera, a friend and I were looking for a nice place for a snack and some drinks. We found The Rabbit Hole - one of the seemingly few places in the financial district open past 10pm on a Friday. We enjoyed cocktails, wine, and food. Nice vibe, I like the upscale pub fe. The service was great, though the definitely wanted to take away our wine glasses...",Audra B.,4
The Rabbit Hole,(38 reviews),"Went for lunch on a Friday afternoon. I've always wanted to try this place because the atmosphere and vibe looks very cool. I'm all for gastropub style foods so I was very excited. Ordered the scotch egg (12), atlantic salmon (32), lentil & winter squash cottage pie (22), and the apple + blackberry crumble (12). I thought the scotch egg was very unique in terms of presentation and taste, really enjoyed it. The salmon was served with a very creamy sauce and a bunch of vegetables along with it. The dish was nice overall but I was expecting a bit more given its steep price. The cottage pie was really big but I thought it in terms flavor it was a bit plain, though the presentation was great. The desert might have been my favorite dish since it was just really delicious. It was served kind of warm since it was a custard and crumble while having the cold taste of the sorbet. Really nice dessert!Service was great and they have a simple reservation process through opentable but since there's just so many options downtown it might be a while since I come back here. Very good stuff though :)",Bosco H.,4

The Rabbit Hole,(38 reviews),"We found The Rabbit Hole by pure accident!! What a find!!!! After traveling all day we decided to get our dinners to go and relax in our suite.  We ordered the Fish and Chips- wait... is this review really about FISH AND CHIPS?!?! You're damn right it is!!! With a 7 minute walk back to the suite- I was anticipating a soggy serving of the fish and some pretty listless chips- nothing could prepare me for the absolute pleasure derived from this meal! The fish was delicious, flavorful, and flaky.  The Ale batter was so crunchy and was the perfect compliment to the fish!! The chips- just as crusty and crunchy as the batter, yet, soft and heavenly on the inside!! We finished that incredible dinner by splitting an order of the Sticky Toffee Pudding.... If you do not experience this decadence- your life is just... well... incomplete!! The perfect ending to a excellent meal!!! We are definitely returning to enjoy the ambience- what I would describe as ""upscale comfy"" English pub.  The service was attentive and so polite and helpful.  We will be back- I mean who the hell writes a review of Fish and Chips?? Have it at the Rabbit Hole and find out for yourself why this just hits different!!! Cheers!!",Mark W.,5
The Rabbit Hole,(38 reviews),"I love this place. It's cute, it's trendy, and the food is pretty good. The Rabbit Hole has Alice in Wonderland vibes with quirky animal wallpaper on the ceilings and a mountain of clocks on its walls. I was looking for a place that could accommodate a larger group of 6, and had a diverse and approachable enough menu for everyone, including children at a reasonable price. Even the pickiest eaters could probably find something they like on the menu at The Rabbit Hole. We started with the bone marrow and the scallops. Everybody enjoyed the appetizers, even the pickiest eater in our group. I ordered the queen's Gaelic steak and it was definitely worth the price. You get a tender steak topped with a rare bit (Welsh cheese-like batter, not rare at all) and portobello mushroom. On the side was duck fat scalloped potatoes. Anyone who knows me knows I have a soft spot for duck fat potatoes, so needless to say I found the food great.",Lilian L.,5
